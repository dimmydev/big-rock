    <h2 class="naslov">A commitment to excellence</h2>
    <p class="opis">1985 was a simpler time.  Beer was either "lager A" or "lager B". But noted beer fan Ed McNally was thirsty for a real choice. And rather than complicate matters by tracking down established import brews, Ed took the "easy" way out and started his own brewery. 
We’re driven by a passion to bring better beer to Canadians every day, everywhere. We’re handcrafted in a high-volume world, and we’re proud of it. We believe today, as our founder Ed McNally believed in 1985, that to raise one glass is to raise an entire industry. The rest is a part of Big Rock Brewery history.</p>
